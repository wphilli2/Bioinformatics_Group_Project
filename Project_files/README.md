This is a repo for the bioinformatics group project in BIOS30318/60318 at the
University of Notre Dame. 

When completed the students' forked repos should contain:
1. A text file of BLAST hits for each sequence in 'uniquetranscripts.fasta' and a txt file containing the top hit for each of the six unique transcripts.
2. A fasta file for each of the six unique transcripts with 10 protein sequences in each file.
3. A hmm for each of the six unique transcripts.
4. Results of a search of four translated RNAseq files for each of the six unique transcript hmms.
5. FIgures of hits for each of the six unique transcripts in the four RNAseq files.
6. Scripts contiaing the code required to generate the above files and results.
7. Files and scripts required to address the short answer questions 1 & 2.
8. A word document with answers to:

	A. The qualitative comparsion of your results with Kihns and Pluznick 2017.

	B. Answers to short answer questions 1 & 2

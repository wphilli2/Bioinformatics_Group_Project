#Download fasta files
#Decompress files
#Send to remote
#Use Blast to Identify genes in transcripts (uniquetranscripts.fasta)
#Save the descriptions and save these to repo
#Make a single table that includes the top hit for each transcript (coding)
#Look for the amino acid sequences corresponding to the transcripts
#Choose 10 protein sequences from mice/related organisms & Download them
#Do a HMM (hmmbuild) for each transcript proteins and search the4 translated "RNAseqfiles"
#Use a bashscript to loop over the 6 transcript files and 4 "RNAseq files"
#Graph the expression levels of each protein in each of the "RNAseqfiles". These must be compared qualitatively to the paper

Ya empez'o a hacer blast

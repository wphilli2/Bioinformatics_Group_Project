First did BLAST, uploaded uniquetranscripts.fasta (in Project_files),
Next, from BLAST list, downloaded top hits for each of the transcripts and saved as Transcript(#).hits in Results_files. *Note that the transcript hits are saved as 
Transcript(1-6).hits, but in the original uniquetranscripts.fasta file, the numbers are NOT 1-6. May need to fix this
Next, used tophits.sh script to take the top hit from each Transcript(#).hits file and appended it to Hits.txt in Results_file. Hits.txt contains the top hit for each of the 
	six transcripts. 
From Hits.txt, take the top nucleotide hit for each transcript and do blastx on NCBI BLAST (This is a nucleotide to protein blast; we have nucleotide hits, but we can get
	the protein matching the top nucleotide hit using blastx). Search the corresponding protein in the NCBI protein database and take 10  proteins from each unique transcript
	from mus musculus and closely related organisms. *all transcripts except for six were searched in rodents; 6 was searched in the larger class of mammals
	 Put the protein lists into a file in Results_files labelled with the protein name followed by trans# 
scp the protein hit files to remote machine in order to use muscle function. On remote machine, create alignment files for each transcript using muscle. 
Still in the remote machine, use hmmerbuild to build a hidden markov model for each transcript's protein hit alignments. Save a Hidden Markov Model profile for each of the 
	transcripts' protein hits
Again in the remote machine, use the newly created Hidden Markov Model profiles for each transcript and hmmsearch to search the 2 control and teh 2 obesity files provided
	in Project_files. Will have to scp these files to the remote machine. Then create unique files for each transcript HMM and the number of hits found in the hmmsearch.
scp the hit data found from the hmmsearch to local machine and use R and ggplot to graphically compare the hits between the transcripts

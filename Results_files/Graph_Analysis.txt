After examining Kuhns and Pluznick's results of the differences in gene expression in obese mice vs control, we are able
to conclude that the differences between both sets of mice seen on our search corroborate the results found by the authors.
As an example we can mention Synaptoporin's high difference in gene expression as per the author's results, which resemble the distance
between the amount of protein produced by obese mice vs control on our results. To contrast we can mention Potassion ATPase, which has a
relatively low difference of protein expression on our results, corresponding to the low difference of gene expression in the study.

Just like the previous set of proteins, we can also see a resemblance in the behavior of
Solute carrier 7 and Glutathione transferase. These resemble Kuhns and Pluznick's results in that SoluteCarrier 7 had a somewhat
minor difference in gene expression, which correspond to the small difference between Obese and Control mice on our results,
whereas Glutathione transferase which is shown to have a larger fold change by the authors, is shown to have a larger difference
of protein expression on our results.

These findings seem to corroborate that there is in fact a difference in gene expression between obese and non-obese mice.

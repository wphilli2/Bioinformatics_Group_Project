This directory has all of the results from this project. There are multiple directories
containing the results:

Transcripts: 
	This directory contains the files containing the hits from the BLAST search on NCBI
	of the uniquetranscrips.fasta file (in the Project_files directory). It also 
	has a file containing the top hit for each transcript.
Protein_hits:
	This directory contains the files containing the selected proteins from a blastx
	search on NCBI of the top hit from each transcript. 
Protein_alignments:
	This directory contains the alignments of the protein lists from Protein_hits.
	The alignments were obtained using muscle. The script containing the code for
	carrying out the alignments is also in this directory.
Protein_hmms
	This directory contains the HMM profiles generated from the alignments in 
	Protein_alignments using hmmerbuild. The script that was used is also in the
	directory.
hmmsearch
	This directory contains a text file with the results of the hmmsearch of 
	the 4 RNA seq files (Control and Obese proteins in Project_files) against the
	profiles in Protein_hmms. The script that was used is also in the directory.
Ptpn5_primate
	This directory contains files relevant to short answer question 2.
	It contains a  new list of proteins for Ptpn5 derived from an NCBI
	search of Ptpn5 for primates. It also contains the alignment of these proteins
	(aligned using muscle and a script similar to that in Protein_alignments) and 
	the HMM profile (generated from this alignment using hmmbuild and a script). 
	The directory contains a script that was used to search Obese1protein.fasta
	against the HMM profile in the directory. Finally, it contains the results of
	this search.
blasn_megablast
	This directory contains files relevant to short answer question 1
scripts
	This directory contains copies of all the scripts used in the project

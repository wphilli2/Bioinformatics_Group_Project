After reviewing the BLAST results for sequences 1 and 2
under the different optimization parameters (Megablast,
Discontinuous megablast and Blastn), it is easy to determine
that Megablast is designed to obtain hits that are either the same
or as close as possible to the sequences being tested. This is in contrast
to discontinuous megablast and blastn which seem to look for sequences
that are a little more dissimilar. Furthermore, megablast
tended to provide less hits than the other two options.

All of this can be seen when you take into account the average
Identity percentages, in which Megablast had slightly higher scores
(averaging at 97.63% for Megablast, vs 96.7% and 96.63% for discontinuous
megablast and blastn respectively). Additionally, Megablast tended
to have a lesser number of hits than the other two optimization parameters.

Finally it is important two mention about the species that came up on each search.
For Megablast, all species present were part of the Rodentia order (Mus sp., Rattus., and
Microtus sp. were some of the most abundant). This differs from the other two
parameters which returned species not only further inside the Rodentia order (ie: Giant Moles and
the Lesser Egyptian Jerboa), but also species from elsewhere in the Mammalia class, such
as primates (ie: babboons, humans, etc), whales, otters, felines and bovines. Thus, allowing
to infer that these two other parameters are designed for phylogenetic studies.

The two proteins I chose to build new HMM profiles for are Ptpn5 and Glutathione S transferase. I searched the proteins on NCBI and then
selected "primates" from the tree. I picked ten proteins for each from the list of primate proteins and carried out the procedure of 
aligning the sequences, building the HMM, and then searching the RNA seq file Obese1protein.fasta against the profiles. 
Looking at the hits obtained from the searches of Obese1 against the Ptpn5 profiles, the hits in both cases have E-values of 0. However,
The bit scores from the primate profile are 1109.3 while the bit scores from the rodent profile are 1292.5. The higher bit score in the 
rodent profile case suggests that building the HMM from more closely related species provides  better quality hits. 
Looking at the hits obtained from the searches of Obese1 against the Glutathione S transferase profile, the hits differ in both E-value
and bit score. The E-value from the rodent profile is 1.4e-140, while the E-value from the primate profile is 2.4e-127. The lower E-value
in the rodent profile suggests that the hits are of higher quality, because there is a lower probability of finding the given sequence 
randomly. Similarly, the bit score in the rodent profile is 461.2, while the bit score is 417.8 in the primate profile. Again, this 
suggests that the hits are of higher quality when the rodent profile is used.
